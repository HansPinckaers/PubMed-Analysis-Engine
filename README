PubMed Data Analysis Engine

    ...a node.js centric project.

    The aim of the project is to make large amounts of pubmed search results easy to mine.
    This is useful because using pubmed is a pain, and decent mining software could increase
    the productivity of pubmed users substantially.

    At the moment the goals are as follows:

	    1. Write a decent interface for the key methods of the NCBI
           web services that return JSON formatted PubMed data.

    	2. Create a set of tables out of the data and add it to an
           SQLITE database with FTS4 full text search support enabled.

    	3. Post processing to add various meta data such as latent semantic
           indexing using svdlibc for example.

    	*. At this point could implement a web service that delivers processed
           pubmed data as sqlite databases as a service

    	4. Build a decent mining inteface for the dataset. Will implement the
           features of FTS4 and other things such as faceted search, sorting, grouping etc.

     Dependencies

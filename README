PubMed Data Analysis Engine

...a node.js centric project.

The aim of the project is to make large amounts of pubmed search results easy to mine. This is useful because using pubmed is a pain, and decent mining software could increase the productivity of pubmed users substantially.

At the moment the goals are as follows:

1. Write a decent interface for the key methods of the NCBI web services that return JSON formatted PubMed data.

2. Add the data to an SQLITE database with FTS4 full text search support enabled.

3. Do some post processing on the data such as latent semantic indexing using svdlibc (for which we'll need a node.js interface).

4. Build a browser based search interface that can provide a mining interface over the dataset. Will implement the features of FTS4 and other things such as faceted search, sorting, grouping etc.

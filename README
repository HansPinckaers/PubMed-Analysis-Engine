# PubMed Data Analysis Engine
# 
# The engine works by querying NCBI web services for pubmed data.
#
# The data is processed. Extra taxonomy information is added and the data is stored in an sqlite database ready for presentation.
#
# An advanced user interface is to be developed which implements advanced search features such as faceting to help users mine the data.
